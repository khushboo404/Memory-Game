# About Memory Game

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. Flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

# How It Works

* **The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.**
* **The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.**
* **If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.**
* **If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.**

# What you need to consider while playing
